Target
======

cardboard_box.svg can be laser cut or die-cut from corrugated cardboard and will fold up. By gluing the 4 circles onto the marked positions on the top of the box, multiple boxes can be stacked and will interlock in a manner similar to a 2Ã—2 lego block. 

As the boxes can be constructed without glue, they can be unfolded after any event to allow for a flat packing range target structure that can be broken down and reused, or reconfigured into another arrangement.
