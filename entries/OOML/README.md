## Progress

2015-01-27 Starting Design, initial upload. Worked on ball shooter.
2015-01-28 Initial design worked on (Prototype One)
2015-02-03 Redesigned for new track style did (Prototype 2)
2015-02-05 Motor mounts ready to work on (Prototype 3)

## Process

### Shooter  

#### Prototype One
![Prototype One](OOML-prototype-01-01_420.jpg)  
##### Summary
Using a single large drive wheel driven by drill. Pressure applied by setting gap with bolts. 
File: OLD01-OOML-working.cdr (all other formats generated)
##### Notes
* Large Wheel too big to spin too quickly
* Layered construction method can be simlified
* Circular magazine seems to work well (needs to be more firmly attached)
* Attaching to the drive shaft will be tricky.

#### Prototype Two
![Prototype Two](OOML-prototype-02-01_420.jpg)  
##### Summary
Using a single drive wheel plans to drive with RC motor but gave up before making adapter. Tried gravity hold down for top wheel.
File: OLD02-OOML-working.cdr (all other formats generated)
##### Notes
* Single wheel drive doesn't seem to be sufficient
* Sandwich style ball run works well, leaves room to mount wheels around,
* Thinking mounting the drive wheel direct to motor is a good idea. (works with larger 'outrunner' style motors that have screw mounting points.

#### Prototype Three
![Prototype Three](OOML-prototype-03-01_420.jpg)   
![Prototype Three](OOML-prototype-03-01_140.jpg)   
Moved to two drive motors. This is a good idea, also added rubber grip wheels which improved performance greatly.

##### Problems
* A lot of issues with clearnces (motors rubbing)
* A lot of nasty layering encountered when assembling.
* Wheels aren't balanced.

### Ammunition Loading
How to deliver as much ammunition as possible to the shooter. Current thinking is a magazine based system with balls pre-loaded and fed by gravity. Perhaps adding a circular mechanism to deliver magazines.
	
#### Prototype One
![Magazine Prototype 1](OOML-AMMUNITION-prototype-01-01_420.jpg)
Made with threaded rod and laser cut quarter circles. Holds balls well, is a lot of laser cutting (Capacity 7 per 30 cm)

#### Prototype Two
![Magazine Prototype 2](OOML-AMMUNITION-prototype-02-01_420.jpg)
Only requires much less laser cutting, extending only requires lengthening threaded rod. (Feels a bit like cheating). (Capacity 8 per 30 cm)

### Turret
Portion for aiming the shooter.
#### Prototype One
