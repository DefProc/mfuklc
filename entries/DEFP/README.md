Design
======

While I'm concentrating on having the target working first, I do have some thoughts and 
directions on what I'm expecting to make for the competition. 

Two motor drive seems the simplest to engineer and attach to the feed mechanism, although 
I was initially favouring three motors in a triangle to be able to control spin in any 
direction. The simpler, single plane mounting of two motors should give a fire with very 
little spin to it, much like a practice tennis ball launcher. 

To add a little backspin to the ball that would flatten the trajectory of the ball slightly 
(a la [hop-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hop-Up_(Airsoft)) I could add a little buckling 
to the top of the drive wheel exit. I'm tempted to leave this until as the last thing to add 
though, because a consistent trajectory would be more important than a flat trajectory for 
scoring on the day. 

My main problem solving, design thinking has mostly been around the ball sorting and loading 
method from a hopper. While I've eliminated the possibility of a large helical magazine 
arrangement (although I did have a very elegant twin spiral lift and sort mechanism idea 
that only needed a single motor drive) my focus has been on trying to get the shortest 
loading path, with the least reliance on gravity so as to allow the maximum feed rate. 

I did a little testing with a modified Nerf Stryfe, and was able to trigger feed 10 rounds 
in 2.25 seconds. As that's 4.44 rounds a second, it's a little under half the 10 rounds a
second that I'm aiming for, but promising. The easiest, most reliable ball sorting methods 
seem to be a wheel with spaces that agitate and sort them. I'm currently favoring a side entry 
wheel that lifts vertically to supply the launching wheels.
